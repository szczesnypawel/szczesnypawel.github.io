My journey through science and technology has been driven by a curiosity about complex systems - from molecular biology to human behavior.

### Scientific Foundations
I built my research foundation across multiple domains:
- **Structural & Evolutionary Biology** at UCSD, Max-Planck Institute, IBB PAS, and University of Warsaw
- **Biomarker Discovery & Diagnostics** at IBB PAS and University of Warsaw
- **Pharmaceutical Research** focusing on drug target selection at Roche
- **Health Technology** development at Nootech (nootropics) and VR therapy applications (2Eye, Fobos)

This research phase contributed to approximately 50 scientific publications, available on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OGHiN0kAAAAJ&hl=pl).

### Building Bridges
My work in Science Policy & Open Science initiatives reflected a growing recognition that scientific progress requires breaking down institutional barriers. I served as an advisor to:
- Polish Academy of Sciences
- Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education  
- European Commission
- UNESCO

### The Next Frontier
Each previous role revealed a common thread: the need to understand complex human systems. This insight led to founding [Neurofusion Lab](https://neurofusionlab.com), where we apply advanced modeling of large language models to decode human behavior through:
- Virtual focus groups
- Population modeling  
- AI-driven behavioral analysis
