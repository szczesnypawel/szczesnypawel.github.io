excerpt: The Yerkes-Dodson law reveals a pattern in how performance relates to pressure. Performance increases to a point, then drops with further arousal. The pattern holds a key detail — this decline appears only for difficult tasks.

Robert Yerkes and John Dodson published their findings in 1908, studying how Japanese dancing mice learned to discriminate between white and black boxes. They varied both task difficulty and the strength of electric shocks used as motivation. The pattern was clear: for easy discriminations, stronger shocks improved performance linearly. For difficult discriminations, moderate shocks produced optimal learning, while strong shocks impaired it.

The finding has been replicated across species and contexts. Humans solving anagrams, rats navigating mazes, students taking exams — all show the same inverted-U relationship between arousal and performance on complex tasks.

Complex cognitive tasks require working memory, mental flexibility, and the ability to hold multiple representations simultaneously. These capacities are finite and fragile. Psychological arousal—whether from time pressure, stakes, or self-imposed intensity — triggers physiological responses that redirect resources away from prefrontal cortex functions.

Under moderate arousal, focus heightens and attention sustains. The task feels challenging but manageable. Beyond that point, a state of cognitive narrowing emerges. The attentional spotlight constricts. Obvious solutions dominate while creative alternatives fade. Working memory capacity drops. Habitual patterns replace adaptive responses to novel situations.

Which brings us to work duration. If cognitive performance follows an inverted-U curve with arousal, and sustained effort gradually increases arousal, then there's a natural limit to productive cognitive work in a single day.

The magic number keeps appearing in different contexts. Cal Newport's deep work research suggests 4 hours as an upper limit for sustained focus. Charles Darwin, reportedly, worked in focused bursts totaling around 4-5 hours daily. Many mathematicians and writers describe similar patterns—intense morning sessions, afternoons for correspondence and lighter tasks.

The historical anecdotes are interesting, but the pattern points to something narrower: a daily bound on high-stakes discrimination. The seventh hour of debugging doesn't just yield less than the third hour—it actively degrades work quality. New bugs appear while attempting to fix existing ones. 

## Implications for Human-AI Cognitive Coupling

The Yerkes-Dodson law reveals an interesting pattern when working with AI systems for cognitive tasks. Extended sessions with language models create a subtle arousal trap.

The AI never tires. It maintains consistent response quality whether it's the first prompt or the fiftieth. This creates an illusion of sustainable intensity. But the human remains subject to the same cognitive limits that existed before language models.

The conversational nature of AI interaction can disguise cognitive fatigue. Dialogue flows, feedback arrives immediately, progress appears. These intrinsically rewarding elements keep arousal elevated. But elevated arousal on a complex task means climbing the wrong side of the curve.

The signs appear: accepting AI suggestions with less critical evaluation, prompts becoming less precise, losing track of the original goal and drifting into tangential explorations. Feeling busy and engaged, yet reviewing the transcript later reveals the last hour produced little of value.


## Task Complexity and Appropriate Intensity

Not all work follows the same pattern. The Yerkes-Dodson law's task complexity dimension reveals this.

For simple, well-defined tasks (reformatting code, running test suites, checking calculations) higher arousal shows no harmful effects. These tasks can be batched and executed when cognitive quality is already degraded.

For complex, novel tasks (system architecture decisions, algorithm design, conceptual debugging) intensity becomes counterproductive beyond a threshold. These demand exactly the mental flexibility and working memory that overarousal degrades.

The pattern reveals itself in daily work: eight hours of coding isn't eight hours of equivalent cognitive demand. Four hours designing system architecture versus four hours implementing boilerplate—the first four cost more and contribute more.
