My journey through science and technology has been driven by a curiosity about complex systems — from molecular biology to human behavior. I'm a biologist (PhD) and a psychologist (second major).

### Scientific Foundations

I built my research foundation across multiple domains:

- **Structural & Evolutionary Biology** at UCSD, Max-Planck Institute, IBB PAS, and University of Warsaw
- **Biomarker Discovery & Diagnostics** at IBB PAS and University of Warsaw
- **Pharmaceutical Research** focusing on drug target selection at Roche/Genentech
- **Health Technology** development at Nootech (nootropics) and VR therapy applications (2Eye, Fobos)

### Building Bridges

My work in Science Policy & Open Science initiatives reflected a growing recognition that scientific progress requires breaking down institutional barriers. I served as an advisor to:

- Polish Academy of Sciences
- Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education
- European Commission
- UNESCO

### The Next Frontier

Each previous role revealed a common thread: the need to understand **complex human systems** — how people think, act, and adapt within networks of tools, incentives, and technologies. This insight led to founding **Neurofusion Lab**, where I explored how large language models can serve as mirrors and amplifiers of human cognition — decoding not just what people say, but **how they construct meaning**. I left the lab and currently work as an independent researcher and designer of human-AI cognitive systems.

My work blends **AI modeling, psychology, and narrative analysis** to understand how technology reshapes human intention, identity, and agency.

## Current Focus

I currently write a book that examines how humans and intelligent systems co-evolve. Major themes:

### *Illegibility*

It explores how systems — from academia to AI — reward legibility, efficiency, and predictability, and how individuals can stay *illegible* enough to remain human. It’s a personal story about curiosity, loss of agency, and the attempt to reclaim one’s own reasons for thinking.

### *Noofusion*

A new cognitive phenomenon: **deep fusion between human and model thinking**.
It investigates what happens when language models stop being tools and start becoming **cognitive partners** — how shared reasoning spaces, blended authorship, and emergent metaphors arise from sustained dialogue between a person and an AI.

### *Homo symbiotelicus*

**Teleology of modern life** — how our goals are increasingly co-constructed with systems (what I call *symbiotelia*), and what it means to preserve or regain **autotelia**, the capacity to generate goals from within.
It connects psychology, systems theory, and cybernetics (Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety) to propose new ways of understanding agency in an age of algorithmic steering.

### *Cognitive Sovereignty*

The overarching theme tying these threads together: an inquiry into how individuals and organizations can navigate hybrid intelligence without losing autonomy. It’s less about resisting technology, and more about learning to **steer it without being rewritten by it**.
